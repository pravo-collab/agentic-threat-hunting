3. **Investigation Agent**: Performs deep forensic analysis
4. **Response Agent**: Executes appropriate response actions
5. **Reporting Agent**: Generates comprehensive incident reports

### Network Monitoring Agents
6. **Network Capture Agent**: Captures and organizes network traffic into flows (5-180s, up to 1M packets)
   - Automatic PCAP file generation
   - Saves to `captures/` directory
   - Compatible with Wireshark, tcpdump, etc.
7. **Network Analysis Agent**: AI-powered analysis of network patterns and anomalies

   - 21 enhanced features per flow
   - 8 intrusion types: DoS, Probe, R2L, U2R, Malware, Botnet, Anomaly, Normal
   - Application classification: Web, Email, DNS, FTP, SSH, Database
   - Threat levels: Critical, High, Medium, Low, Safe
   - Real-time processing (<10ms per flow)

**Both paths converge** at the Analysis Agent for consistent threat handling.
### Workflow Routing
- **Router Node**: Intelligently routes to file upload or network capture path

## Agent Workflow

The system uses a **dual-path LangGraph workflow** with intelligent routing:

### Path 1: File Upload
1. **Router** â†’ **Detection Agent** analyzes security events
2. If threat detected â†’ **Analysis Agent** determines severity
3. **Investigation Agent** performs forensic analysis
4. **Response Agent** plans containment actions
5. **Reporting Agent** generates final report

### Path 2: Network Capture (Full Pipeline)
1. **Router** â†’ **Network Capture Agent** captures traffic (5-180s)
2. **Network Analysis Agent** analyzes flows with AI
3. If threat detected â†’ **Detection Agent** (creates security event)
4. **Analysis Agent** determines severity
5. **Investigation Agent** performs forensic analysis
6. **Response Agent** plans containment actions
7. **Reporting Agent** generates final report

**Both paths converge** at the Analysis Agent for consistent threat handling.

See [WORKFLOW_PATHS.md](WORKFLOW_PATHS.md) for detailed workflow documentation.
