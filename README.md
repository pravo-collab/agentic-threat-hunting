# Agentic MultiStage Threat Hunting and Incident Response System

An intelligent, multi-agent cybersecurity system built with LangGraph for automated threat hunting, detection, analysis, and incident response.

## Overview

This project implements an agentic AI system that orchestrates multiple specialized agents to perform comprehensive threat hunting and incident response operations. The system uses LangGraph to coordinate agents through different stages of the security workflow.

## Features

- **Multi-Stage Threat Detection**: Automated detection across multiple security layers
- **Intelligent Threat Analysis**: AI-powered analysis of security events and anomalies
- **Automated Incident Response**: Coordinated response actions based on threat severity
- **Agent Orchestration**: LangGraph-based workflow management
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous security monitoring and alerting
- **Threat Intelligence Integration**: Integration with threat intelligence feeds
- **Forensic Analysis**: Detailed investigation and evidence collection

## Architecture

The system consists of several specialized agents:

1. **Detection Agent**: Monitors logs and identifies potential threats
2. **Analysis Agent**: Analyzes detected threats and determines severity
3. **Investigation Agent**: Performs deep forensic analysis
4. **Response Agent**: Executes appropriate response actions
5. **Reporting Agent**: Generates comprehensive incident reports
